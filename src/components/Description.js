			<h6>NOBU HOTEL IN SILICON VALLEY</h6>
			<h3>DOWNTOWN PALO ALTO</h3>
			<p>WHERE MODERN JAPANESE DESIGN MEETS WEST COAST LUXURY LIFESTYLE</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				​Our 73-room boutique hotel in the heart of Silicon Valley is undergoing
				an exciting transformation to elevate your Nobu experience to new
				heights, starting the moment you check-in. You will arrive by way of a
				grand spiral staircase with floating stone treads and a carved teak
				handrail, set above the globally acclaimed Nobu Restaurant.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Then you will be welcomed into a light-filled lounge with rich wood,
				Crema Marfil stone, Venetian plaster ceilings, and luxurious furnishings
				like George Nakashima’s legendary chairs and John Wigmore’s ethereal
				light sculptures.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Designed by LA-based Montalba Architects, the Hotel will also feature a
				new façade of chiseled stone, textured with waves of cream and gold. The
				peaceful and buoyant design will express subtle echoes and contrasts
				with the hotel’s commanding views of the city, Stanford University, the
				Santa Cruz Mountains, and the surrounding Bay Area foothills.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>Enjoy world-renowned Nobu hospitality, Palo Alto-style.</p>
